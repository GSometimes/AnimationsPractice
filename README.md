# Little Black Book - Capstone

Little Black Book is a personal blog/journal that I've made showcasing unique animations and is an ode to one of my instructors who's been a huge support and a mentor to me.

## Project Overview

For my Capstone project I'm going to be building a blog/journal application that utilizes React, Contentful, and CSS Animations to create a visually appealing application.

## Motivation

My motivation for this project was a small way to say thank you to those that have helped me through this cohort and to showcase a first iteration of something I'd like to be a "signature style" of mine.

## Framework Used

**Built with:**

- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Contentful](https://contentful.com/)

## API Reference

[Contentful](https://cdn.contentful.com/spaces/aj2z11014ie9/environments/master/content_types?access_token=E-WVKhMtADWilyoTTIu4Pv76EX0gC53hkLIDTBX7h1c) was utilized as the API for the blog entries. It was my first time using it and it's something I plan on getting more familiar with and utilizing often.

## Navigation

You can navigate the page through the "navSquare" that is positions in the middle of the application. It will take you through various pages that include personal blog entries, a small section on me and my inspiration, and an example template to show off a portfolio.

## Credits

The main reference that I used to create this application was [this Portfolio](https://www.signesduquotidien.org/). I came across it while I was researching layouts and I knew that I wanted to utilize it for something. I did my own, first, iteration of it and look to refactor and add to the collection of entries.
